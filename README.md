# Bankist Website

## Overview
I implemented the JavaScript functionality for this website by following a tutorial in Jonas Schmedtmann's [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). I practiced advanced DOM manipulation and used JavaScript features such as event delegation, the intersection observer API, and short circuiting. I learned how to build website elements such as lazy loading, smooth scrolling, tabbed components, and more.
